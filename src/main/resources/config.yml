# WorldEdit's configuration file
#
# About editing this file:
# - DO NOT USE TABS. You MUST use spaces or Bukkit will complain. If
#   you use an editor like Notepad++ (recommended for Windows users), you
#   must configure it to "replace tabs with spaces." In Notepad++, this can
#   be changed in Settings > Preferences > Language Menu.
# - Don't get rid of the indents. They are indented so some entries are
#   in categories (like "max-blocks-changed" is in the "limits"
#   category.
# - If you want to check the format of this file before putting it
#   into WorldEdit, paste it into http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
#   and see if it gives "ERROR:".
# - Lines starting with # are commentsand so they are ignored.

# Currently Bukkit's internal permissions API has no understanding of an "OP" value (whereby the player is given the 
# permission if they are an operator). This is a workaround for this which allows us to use the default permissions defined 
# in WorldEdit (OPs can do everything) and allows us to disable certain features an OP can use, using permissions. For 
# example they can use all commands if they are an OP (as by default) but if I define 'worldedit.region.set: false' in a 
# group the OP is a member of it disallows that OP to set blocks. There is no point setting this to true if 
# no-op-permissions is set to true aswell.
