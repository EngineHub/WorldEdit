=========

WorldEdit is Minecraft mod that turns Minecraft into an in-game map editor (sorta, kinda).

* Make awesome stuff with half the time OR make ***quadriply** awesome* creations with the same time :sparkles:
* Get lost in hundreds of options and functions that even we've forgotten existed
* Utilize Photoshop-like tools like "selection areas" and "brushes"
* Making fjords and other natural wonders with weird names
* Also: fix grief, broken water, missing snow, raging fires, and other :poop:

WorldEdit is open source!, so if you've just learned how to make a button blink, I probably recommend picking up a book on CS algorithms. The project is licensed using the GNU Lesser General Public License license, v3.
