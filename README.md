* Change thousands of blocks in an area at once by selecting regions.
* Use over 100 functions to modify the world or remove problems.
* Remove large chunks of land as you wish.
* Sculpt the world and build mountains with brushes.
* Fix annoyances such as broken water, missing snow, raging fires, and more.

WorldEdit is open source and is available under the GNU General Public License v3.
