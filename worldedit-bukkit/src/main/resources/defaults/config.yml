# WorldEdit's Configuration File
#
# About editing this file:
# - DO NOT USE TABS. You MUST use spaces or Bukkit will complain and post
#   errors. If you use an editor, like Notepad++ (recommended for Windows
#   users), you must configure it to "replace tabs with spaces."
#   This can be changed in Settings > Preferences > Language Menu.
# - Don't get rid of indentations. They are indented so some entries that are
#   in categories, like "max-blocks-changed", are placed in the "limits"
#   category.
# - If you want to check the format of this file before putting it
#   into WorldEdit, paste it into http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
#   and see if it gives you "ERROR:".
# - Lines starting with # are comments, so they are ignored.
# - If you want to allow blocks, make sure to change "disallowed-blocks" to []
#
