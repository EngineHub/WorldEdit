# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest release of Minecraft, and the latest release of our software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported to our security email, `security@enginehub.org`.

WorldEdit is designed to be an admin tool. We do not consider users being able to break limits or cause lag security vulnerabilities _if they are given permission to run the commands_. Only performance issues resulting from players without permissions are considered security vulnerabilities.
