4.6:
- Updated for Minecraft 1.6.
- Added flood fill tool. Use /floodfill <block> <radius> and right click blocks
    to flood fill them.
- Added //gmask to set a *GLOBAL* mask that affects nearly ALL operations.
    Now you can confine //sphere to a region or create //walls that do not
    replace existing blocks.
- Added a region-based mask that confines changes to the current region
    (when the mask is set).
- Added support for combining masks, i.e. /mask #region rock,brick
- Added //fast mode, which allows the server to skip the dirtying of chunks.
    This means that you have to rejoin to see changes though, but most
    operations are doubled in speed. This only applies to the Bukkit version
    at the moment.
- Changed the block type check to be implementation-dependent. The Bukkit
    plugin now checks Bukkit's Material.

    or not in Bukkit yet.
- Added permission checks for tools on use, so now if you switch world or
    lose your permissions, you lose your tools.
- Added expiration timer to sessions. Sessions will now last up to 10 minutes
    (by default) before removed, so you can quickly disconnect (or crash) and
    come back and still maintain your history.
- Removed minimum cap on history size (now you have history sizes under 15).

4.4.1:
- Maven-built release.
- Sun Rhino removed.

- Fixed snapshot restoration not working on sign blocks and other special
    tile entity blocks.
- Added beds as a place-last block.
- Fixed beds and redstone repeaters not being set.
- Added an alias for wool colors as though they were blocks, so you can now
    do //set blue, etc.
- Removed "blue" as an alias for lapis lazuli.

4.0-beta8:
- Added things for CraftBook.

4.0-beta7:
- Added 1.3 block support.

4.0-beta6:
- Fixed //count being ///count.
- Added a workaround to the fact that Minecraft no longer sends a block
    dig packet for bedrock. WorldEdit now detects if you're hitting bedrock,
    but it may not be entirely accurate (torches will trick it!).
- Removed /t on request of Kainzo.
- Fixed second position setting commands saying position one instead of two
    when selecting cuboids.

4.0-beta5:
- Fixed permissions with brush commands.

- /butcher now works for slimes and ghasts and will no longer drop items.
- The tool system has been overhauled so that when you use a tool, it gets
    bound to your currently held item. For example, you could bind the tree
    tool to a wooden sword and the brush tool to a diamond axe.
- Brush commands have been broken up. Use /brush, /mat, and /size to adjust
    a brush's settings. A different brush can be bound to different items.
- //wand now gives the wand item directly.
- New mask support allows you to filter the blocks that would be changed.
    This currently only works for brushes.
- Added some API methods.
- Added multiple undo/redo.
- Added -c flag to //distr to print to console.

- Fixed /removenear not taking a default size argument.
- Improved overall performance.

3.1:
- Added more tree generators. /tree [type] and
    /forestgen [size] [type] [density] are the new commands.
- No longer using the internal Rhino JavaScript engine, so Windows users
    will now have to download Rhino separately to use scripting.

3.0:
- Added /searchitem or //l command to lookup items and block by name and ID.
- Added block data cycling super pickaxe tool. (/cycler)
- Added //paste [-ao] syntax to paste without air and at origin.
- Added support for //stack [-a] to not stack air.
- Added the ability to configure the schematic and CraftScript directories.
- Added better support for cake, added some more block/item aliases.
- Added support for rotation block orientation with the rotate and flip
    commands (now stairs, torches, etc. will rotate correctly).

    and clipboard) for the brush tools.
- Added in a valid block ID check.
- Added debugging information for when no snapshots could be found.
- Added pattern support to //overlay (i.e. //overlay 3%torch,97%air).
- Added a clipboard pattern (//set #clipboard) -- useful for repeating
    patterns over an area.
- Changed the arm swing tools to also work on right click.
- Improved block drop list (thanks to Gunther De Wachter).
- Fixed scripting.timeout setting taking no effect.
- Fixed group checking with Permissions.
- Moved commands around in the code and added hierarchical permissions
    support in the process. All permission systems supported by WorldEdit
    (and utilizing plugins) support hierarchy, regardless if they really
    do or not. WorldEdit will simulate hierarchy as required.

2.15.2:
- Minor additions for ease of integration.

2.15.1:
- Fixed /script.js shortcut not stripping forward slashes.
- Changed some internal working directory handling code to better support
    single player modifications.

2.15:
- Added roof.js by Bentech. It makes a roof over your selection.

- Added support for specifying color names instead of data values for cloth.
- For the brush tools and the compass, you now have to SWING with your arm.
- Right click with the compass now toggles between /thru and /jumpto.
- The algorithm for /thru was improved.
- Fixed quickshot.js not reading notes correctly.
- Fixed /butcher. (I also added necessary methods to Bukkit so you now
    have to update that too.)
- draw.js now supports orientation and choses white wool for white pixels
    instead of pink! (Thanks to Dean Ward.)
- Improved /info tool to handle more block data.
- Changed /s to /.s to avoid conflicts.
- Now you can use /script.js directly as a command.
- Improved /info tool to handle more block data.

2.14.2:
- Fixed array out of bounds error with snapshots.

2.14.1:
- Improved some error messages.
- Fixed snapshots not supporting all block types.
- Fixed forest generator.

2.14:

- Added /s to repeat last script.

2.13:
- Scripting support is back!
- Colored cloth blocks should now work.
- Fixed issue where the command's arguments were printed to chat when
    you also did not have permissions.

2.12:
- Added new flat file permissions resolver, added * support for
    ConfigurationPermissionsResolver.
- Added support for Niji's permission system.
- Fixed bad list to array conversion in ConfigurationPermissionsResolver.
- Fixed default permissions with the built-in permission resolvers.
- Fixed issue with BlockWorldVector causing java.lang.VerifyError due to
    how Bukkit loads plugins.
- Ops now have all permissions.
- Changed /reload WorldEdit to /reloadwe.
- Moved WorldEdit to use Bukkit's command registration. Let's hope
    this didn't break things.

2.11:
- Ported over toi's ray tracing code so that it's now included in
    WorldEdit. This will make porting WorldEdit to single player
    and other platforms easier.
- Fixed NullPointerExceptions that appeared while saving a chest.
- Fixed NullPointerExceptions in some super pickaxe modes, made arm swing
    handler get called on item usage. This means that you can use
    /brush and /rbrush now but you right click in the air instead of
    swinging your arm.
- Made super pickaxe arm swing and right click modes mutually exclusive.
- Added the navigation wand. Normally a swing of your navigation wand
    would call /jumpto, but in the mean time you have to right click.

2.10:
- Inventory support now works for Bukkit.
- Now /jumpto and /thru works.
- Now prints an error message if permission is not available.
- Added support for cloth color with the super pickaxe drops.
- Updated GroupUsers support to use GroupUsers' new API. GroupUsers
    must be updated as well.
- Added wand-item to default config.yml.

2.8.1:
- Added some extra functions to Vector for WorldGuard.
- Made setup easier and less confusing.

2.8:

- /thru should now treat torches and such as pass-through blocks.

2.7.1:
- Added tree and item drop support for the Bukkit version.

2.7:
- Added sphere brush tool. Use /sphere <id> [radius] [noReplace?] to
    enable it and /none to disable it (note: /none also disables the
    right click super pickaxe tool). The brush tool builds a sphere at the
    location that you are looking at. For the last argument, put "true"
    or "yes" to prevent the brush from replacing non-air blocks.
- Changed water to be considered a pass-through block. This means that
    /thru, /jumpto, and such commands will ignore water.
- /tree now makes regular tree and /bigtree makes big trees. /forestgen
    will still make big tree forests.
- The block replacer tool should now support inventory.
- Fixed the NullPointerException with /jumpto and similar commands.
- Made handling of non-right angles in getDirection() return more
    relevant errors. Now //stack and similar commands won't give you the
    cryptic error of "Unknown direction: me".
- Updated sample worldedit.properties file.

2.6:
- Removed 'air' prefix from commands. Now //pasteair is just //paste,
    //moveair is just //move, etc.
- Made /worldeditselect permission more encompassing, now including //chunk,
    //expand, and //contract.
- Added syntax for //expand <amt> <reverse-amt> <direction> which allows
    you to expand in two directions at once. This also works for //contract.
- Added //expand vert|vertical to expand the selection from top to bottom.
- Added /thaw to reverse /snow.
- Fixed WorldEdit not handling ice removal well.
- Fixed some inaccuracy problems regarding player positions caused by a
    recent update.
- Fixed the tree generator.
- Code reorganized a little more.

2.5.1:
- Fixed the WorldEdit bridge used by CraftBook and other plugins.
- Fixed issues with permissions where the only reliable permission was
    /worldedit.

2.5:
- Fixed issues with permissions not being read correctly.
- WorldEdit is now world-aware (not that the Minecraft server is).
- Abstracted super pickaxe mode/tools and changed commands to /tree, /info,
    /none, /single, /area, and /recur.
- New /repl super pickaxe tool.
- Now bundling JNBT.
- Add a very rudimentary command line program that will check the integrity
    (a very basic integrity check) of a world.

2.4:
- Added the ability to use (require) inventory with operations, preventing
    people from setting blocks that they don't have.
- Simplified the max blocks change limit to be binary (either you have it or
    not). Also separated the 'max' limit and the 'default' limit in terms
    of configuration. This means that the WorldEdit restrictions file is
    no longer used.
- A large part of the code was moved around (again) to make porting
    WorldEdit to other modding APIs easier, but this means that something
    may have broken.
- Chest handling was rewritten for Minecraft beta, so it should be
    reliable now and not cause exceptions.
- Item damage is now managed by WorldEdit's chest handling APIs.
- Worked around an issue with the java.util.zip implementation that
    caused ZIP files containing backslashes to not work correctly.
- Changed the TrueZip support to use the API for java.util.zip, meaning
    some bugs should be fixed.
- Made all commands support double forward slashes as the command prefix.

2.3.4:
- Fixed issues with chests.
- Added configuration option that disables the "//" prefix and lets you use
    single forward slashes too.

2.3.3
- Updated for beta.
- Fixed error caused by not specifying a mob spawner type when using mob
    spawner blocks.
- Improved version detection to be more reliable.
- Fixed incorrect item drops for the super pickaxe.

2.3.2:
- Fixed the history/queue array lists being iterated in the wrong direction.
    //move should be fixed as a result.

2.3.1:
- Updated for b129+ and v0.2.6_02.

2.3:
- Blocks should now be set and removed correctly so that they don't
    drop items.
- /fixwater and /fixlava should no longer cross solely diagonally connected
    pools.
- Fixed //smooth lifting water upwards.
- Added //shift to move the selection.
- Added //flip to flip the clipboard.
- ; instead of | can be used when specifying extra tile entity data
    for blocks that support them.
- Items are now dropped by the super pickaxe (configurable).
- The info tool is governed by the permission /infotool and the tree tool
    is now goverened by the /treetool permission.
- New info tool (//tool info) that tells you information about the block
    that you right click with a pickaxe on, including the type of mob
    spawned by a mob spawner.
- Mob spawners are now supported for all operations. To specify a mob type,
    use syntax like //set mobspawner;Pig or //set mobspawner|Pig
- Added a catch for the IOException now thrown by recent versions of hMod.

2.2.1:
- Fixed compatibility with server v0.2.5.

2.2:
- Added Grum's //smooth command to smooth terrain. Select the entire area
    and use //smooth on it, perhaps specifying a number of iterations,
    with a larger number of iterations meaning a smoother terrain. Trees and
    other blocks like fences currently do not drop.
- Fixed output messages for //pos2 and //hpos2 when used.
- Updated for server version 0.2.5.

2.1:
- Switched usage of HashMaps to double ArrayLists in the history function,
    increasing the speed of everything by up to 20x.
- The data values of blocks that use them won't be set anymore, decreasing
    the packet spam generated.
- Added //fillr that recursively fills (it's //fill except it will
    fill nooks and crannies).
- Fixed /unstuck lifting you when you weren't stuck.
- Added a filename character whitelist to schematic saving/loading
    routines. (regex: ^[A-Za-z0-9_\- \./\\'\$@~!%\^\*\(\)\[\]\+\{\},\?]+$)
- Expanded the character whitelist for snapshot names (to the same as the
    one for schematic saving/loading).
- .schematics now save original copy offset.
- Added //count that counts the number of blocks in a region.
- Added //distr that prints the distribution of blocks in a region.
- Added /butcher to kill all/nearby mobs.
- Added mob killing to the super pickaxe.

2.0.2:
- Fixed issues with /listsnapshot and //restore not working.

    (Undo is supported!)
- Added recursive super pickaxe mode that destroys blocks adjacent,
    destroying only blocks of the same type as the block that you clicked on
- Added area super pickaxe mode that destroys a cuboid area on use,
    destroying only blocks of the same type as the block that you clicked on.
- Added pasting at origin and saving origin to .schematics.
- Added /chunk to select all the blocks inside the chunk that you are in.
- Shortcut /replacenear lets you replace nearby blocks.
    Example: /replacenear 50 rock glass

- Changed /forestgen to generate forests using Notch's tree algorithm
    (fully undoable).
- Improved speed of commands that iterated over cuboids by 5-40%.
- Support for setting random block content with //set.
    Example: //set 5%diamondore,95%glass
    Numbers don't have to add up to any particular number.
- Block IDs are now resolved with hMod as well, should it fail to resolve
    with WorldEdit.

- Added /listchunks
- Added /delchunks (creates a shell script).

0.11:
