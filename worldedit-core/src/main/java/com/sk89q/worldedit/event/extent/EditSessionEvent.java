/**
 * Raised (several times) when a new {@link EditSession} is being instantiated.
 *
 * <p></p>Block loggers, as well as block set interceptors, can use this event to wrap
 * the given {@link Extent} with their own, which would allow them to intercept
 * all changes made to the world. For example, the code below would wrap the
 * existing extent with a custom one, and the custom extent would receive
 * all method calls <strong>before</strong> the extent fetched from
 * {@link #getExtent()} would.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * event.setExtent(new MyExtent(event.getExtent())
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p></p>This event is fired several times during the creation of a single
 * {@link EditSession}, but {@link #getStage()} will differ each time.
 * The stage determines at which point {@link Extent}s added to this event
 * will be called. For example, if you inject an extent when the stage
 * is set to {@link Stage#BEFORE_HISTORY}, then you can drop (or log) changes
 * before the change has reached the history, reordering, and actual change
 * extents, <em>but</em> that means that any changes made with
 * {@link EditSession#rawSetBlock(BlockVector3, BlockStateHolder)} will skip your
 * custom {@link Extent} because that method bypasses history (and reorder).
 * It is thus recommended that loggers intercept at {@link Stage#BEFORE_CHANGE}
 * and block interceptors intercept at BOTH {@link Stage#BEFORE_CHANGE} and
 * {@link Stage#BEFORE_HISTORY}.</p>
