# Get blocks from a player's inventory when a block is needed and also
# put blocks into a player's inventory with a block is replaced with air.
# When a block cannot be fetched (if, for example, the player has no more
# of that block), the operation will still continue but be unable to set
# any further blocks (at least of that type). Players will be given a list
# of missing block types at the end. If there are any missing blocks that
# do not require another block (such as a torch, which requires a wall or
# floor), the operation will abort before these dependent blocks are
# placed. In the case of failure, //undo and //redo can be utilized to
# repeat an operation. When a block is placed into a player's inventory
# as a result of a block being removed, it will be the mined block, or
# no block in some cases. Glass and bookshelf books are given. Water and
# lava blocks are not given and are not needed for setting. Note that
# chests will not copy correctly and instead drop their items when they
# are removed, preventing the copying and pasting of chests in order to
# duplicate items. Inventory usage is programmed into a very low level of
# WorldEdit, and so all operations will use it.
